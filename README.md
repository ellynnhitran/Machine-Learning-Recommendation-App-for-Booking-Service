# Machine-Learning-Recommendation-App-for-Booking-Service
Developed a hotel recommendation system for Dinogo's Corporate Challenge, using SQL, Keras, and Machine Learning. Achieved 76% prediction accuracy by analyzing millions of data points to rank and recommend top hotels. Confidential code and data due to NDA; demo video and pitch deck available.

  1. Why this product?

This app is a solution for Corporate Challenge from Developer Circles Vietnam Innovation Challenge: https://devc-challenge.coderschool.vn/

The challenge is from Dinogo, an online travel application and hotel is their top prioritized focus in 2020. With thousands of hotels can be booked for every destination, this can be an overwhelming task for customers. Therefore, Dinogo needs a personalized hotel booking system for its users.

  2. About product:​

The recommendation system provides the best experience for customers in hotel booking, to predict and recommend 5 most suitable hotels to each user in hundreds of distinct hotels.

​Tech stacks: SQL, Keras, Machine Learning, Google Colab.

​As I signed the NDA with the company, I could not reveal the code & data I tackled & handled. However, you could watch the video demo on the right & the pitch deck that we presented.

  3. Achievements:

Built recommendation system for hotel meta search app with several millions of data, measured by 76% exact in prediction by mapping various results from booking services, filtering & ranking hotels based on users’ preferences.


  4. Responsibilities: 

As a Data Scientist of the team, I am responsible for building the Machine Learning algorithm which runs inside the app, which includes 2 main parts: ranking system and recommendation system. After analyzing million-user data from TripI, I cleaned the data and tried multiple algorithms to observe which is the best way to rank the hotels and recommend to users.
